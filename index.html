        <b>hello world</b><br>
        i'd like to start with saying hi<br> 
        <br>i gave birth to this website for two reasons: <br>
        1. give me a new project that i have 0 experience in. <br>
        2. use the website as an outlet to get some more writing out. <br><br>

        i'm giving myself the goal to write an entry everyday for a year. my first goal
        with this website was to have it completed by my 24th birthday, in july, but i 
        kinda did it sooner than i imagined(still a work in progress). i'd also like to 
        use this as a second space to show yall what i'm up to. i've been tired of instagram 
        for awhile and currently its off my phone and i just log in on my computer. hopefully 
        someday in the future i'm able to log out from there too but i'm still bound by FOMO< / 3 
        <br><br>
        thanks for checking it out, <br>
        a 
    </p>
