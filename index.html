        <b>keanu reeves & my escape from responsibility</b><br>
        in my senior year of highschool, a friend of mine wrote a piece in the school paper<br>
        about how he felt alone when being surrounded by his friends. i think about it often.<br> 
        i think about the fact that at that same time i was feeling the same way in the same<br> 
        group of friends and that maybe i was contributing to his feeling of lonliness. <br> 
        i thought that if i laughed louder, was in on more of the jokes, mock others, <br> 
        i finally would put lonliness behind me.<br><br> 
        i wish i had talked to my friend about his piece in the paper, told him how much<br> 
        i related to him at this time. we're close friends now but i can't help but think<br> 
        maybe we could have been closer then too.<br><br> 
        anyway... i saw keanu reeves lastnight<br><br> 
        bye, <br>

        <b>stolen bottles</b><br>
        t tells me i have an active dream state. most mornings i wake up by her side<br>
        and i'll tell her about the most fantastical thing or some long lost memory.<br>
        some mornings i'll hold my tongue, if it's a dream thats sensitive to me<br> 
        or something i feel ashamed about. last night i had a dream that i was <br> 
        waking up in my bed to a bunch of text messages. messages from my mother<br> 
        who was livid with me and a picture she took of our liquor cabinet downstairs.<br>
        she had noticed that i've been stealing bottles. in this dream i felt real <br>
        shame. something deep in my stomach had dropped and i felt small. <br><br>
        now really i've been stealing bottles from them since i was a teenager<br>
        but this dream brought up feelings that i had never really felt about<br> 
        the act. i used to feel a rush of adrenaline when doing it later met with anxiety<br> 
        that i had either taken a bottle that they cared about or that they would find it.<br> 
        they have never found out. <br><br>
        bye, <br>

        <b>hello world</b><br>
        welcome to my website and my first entry<br> 
        <br>i gave birth to this website for two reasons: <br>
        1. give me a new project that i have 0 experience in. <br>
        2. use the website as an outlet to get some more writing out. <br><br>

        i've set a goal for myself to write an entry everyday for a year.<br>
        my first goal with this website was to have it completed by my 24th<br>
        birthday, in july, but i kinda did it sooner than i imagined(still <br>
        a work in progress). i'd also like to use this as a second space to <br>
        show yall what i'm up to, photos/videos/etc. i've been tired of instagram<br>
        for awhile and currently its off my phone and i just log in on my computer. <br>
        hopefully someday in the future i'm able to log out from there <br>
        too but i'm still bound by FOMO< / 3 
        <br><br>
        thanks for checking it out, <br>
        a 
    </p>
