        sorry y'all. i get self-conscious whenever i put myself out there and <br> 
        and  i am somewhat an expert at self-sabotage.<br><br> 
        i want to be unwavering when it comes to my creativity. i feel an endless<br> 
        source of it inside of me and i'm constantly researching and wanting to start<br> 
        new projects. sometimes at the detriment to current projects or even responsibilities.<br> 
        i am constantly thinking of cool things i could be working on or making but i always<br> 
        stop myself with thoughts of self-doubt. maybe what i'm making is too dumb, or <br> 
        maybe no one will care, or that maybe i'm a narcissist for wanting to share things <br> 
        that i'm working on. me, me , me.<br>
        whatever, i'll try to keep these coming.<br><br>

        <b>i think i'm dumb</b><br> 
        i think i'm dropping out of school. does it really count if it's community<br> 
        college. i haven't been going for the past few weeks and i've nearly flunked<br> 
        all my classes i'm taking this semester. i lied to t and to my parents. <br> 
        the lie felt too natural, too effortless. 'my teacher cancelled today's class', <br> 
        'it was just a lab today and i'm caught up on my work', or 'im feeling a little sick'. <br> 
        i preoccupy myself with a million other things just to distract myself from the work. <br><br> 
        this website was one of my distractions. i don't think i'm dumb, or incapable of learning.<br> 
        maybe just too anxious.<br><br>

        i think if i were to stop smoking i wouldn't know what to do with my hands.<br> 
        when i put both of my hands in my pockets, it makes me feel small. like i want to tuck<br> 
        away and disappear into my jeans. if i have my hands by my side i feel aimless, they<br> 
        belong nowhere and have no goal. so i think i'll keep buying packs at $12.76 and give<br> 
        my hands purpose for a couple minutes a day. <br> <br>

        i often find myself elsewhere. lost in thought of an imaginary future. <br>

        this version of me in my thoughts has sorted his life into segments. responibilities, <br>
        leisure, and passion. each segment i am an expert. i know how to be responsible at the <br>

        <b>keanu reeves & my escape from responsibility</b><br>
        in my senior year of highschool, a friend of mine wrote a piece in the school paper<br>
        about how he felt alone when being surrounded by his friends. i think about it often.<br> 
        i think about the fact that at that same time i was feeling the same way in the same<br> 
        group of friends and that maybe i was contributing to his feeling of lonliness. <br> 
        i thought that if i laughed louder, was in on more of the jokes, mock others, <br> 
        i finally would put lonliness behind me.<br><br> 
        i wish i had talked to my friend about his piece in the paper, told him how much<br> 
        i related to him at this time. we're close friends now but i can't help but think<br> 
        maybe we could have been closer then too.<br><br> 
        anyways... i saw keanu reeves lastnight<br><br>

        <b>stolen bottles</b><br>
        t tells me i have an active dream state. most mornings i wake up by her side<br>
        and i'll tell her about the most fantastical thing or some long lost memory.<br>
        some mornings i'll hold my tongue, if it's a dream thats sensitive to me<br> 
        or something i feel ashamed about. last night i had a dream that i was <br> 
        waking up in my bed to a bunch of text messages. messages from my mother<br> 
        who was livid with me and a picture she took of our liquor cabinet downstairs.<br>
        she had noticed that i've been stealing bottles. in this dream i felt real <br>
        shame. something deep in my stomach had dropped and i felt small. <br><br>
        now really i've been stealing bottles from them since i was a teenager<br>
        but this dream brought up feelings that i had never really felt about<br> 
        the act. i used to feel a rush of adrenaline when doing it later met with anxiety<br> 
        that i had either taken a bottle that they cared about or that they would find it.<br> 
        they have never found out. <br><br>

        <b>hello world</b><br>
        welcome to my website and my first entry<br> 
        <br>i gave birth to this website for two reasons: <br>
        1. give me a new project that i have 0 experience in. <br>
        2. use the website as an outlet to get some more writing out. <br><br>

        i've set a goal for myself to write an entry everyday for a year.<br>
        my first goal with this website was to have it completed by my 24th<br>
        birthday, in july, but i kinda did it sooner than i imagined(still <br>
        a work in progress). i'd also like to use this as a second space to <br>
        show yall what i'm up to, photos/videos/etc. i've been tired of instagram<br>
        for awhile and currently its off my phone and i just log in on my computer. <br>
        hopefully someday in the future i'm able to log out from there <br>
        too but i'm still bound by FOMO< / 3 
        <br><br>
        thanks for checking it out, <br>
        a
